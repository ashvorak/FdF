# FdF

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as
a parameter to your program.

Each number corresponds to a point in space:
• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
• The value corresponds to its altitude.
